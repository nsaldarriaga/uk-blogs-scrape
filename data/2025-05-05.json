Where several developments may occur in an area, small amounts pulled together could provide long-term opportunities for young people close to home. A community-based monitoring officer would have eyes and ears on the street much of the time. Site checks and reporting back issues to the planning ecologist could be achieved with little delay. Fixed-point photo locations could be mapped to engage local people to monitor maturing habitats and note species seen. In London there has already been some progress in this with organisations such as Greenspace Information for Greater London, Green Talk and others looking at how online platforms could engage local people and provide training whilst helping Councils deliver on their strategic priorities.",

The need for on-site enhancements provides an opportunity to improve the current status quo to avoid nature-rich greening being lost from urban areas.
