In the innovative devices team, one of my colleagues collaborated with the MHRA\u2019s Digital and Technology team to develop a chatbot that we now use internally. This clever bit of kit uses large language models to interrogate and provide an initial response to enquiries, drawing on a rich history of previous answers. At the moment, we\u2019re only using it within the team in an active trial where we closely check the responses before going back to the enquirer. My hope is that, after plenty of thorough testing, we\u2019ll eventually be able to share this chatbot more widely with people looking for clarity on published guidance from the MHRA.",

It\u2019s fair to say I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the outcomes from this phase of the Airlock, because I can already see the huge opportunities these technologies will bring to healthcare \u2013 both now and in the future.

We\u2019ll be rolling these changes out gradually, with the first set of updates expected in late November or early December. Looking further ahead into 2026, the MHRA, together with the Department of Business and Trade, will keep refining the designated standards lists to ensure they stay in step with changing regulatory needs. We are developing a new internal process to make sure the list remains responsive to the emergence of new and updated standards, which is especially important as medical technologies continue to evolve at pace.

As soon as this has been published, we\u2019ll be asking for feedback on the costs to businesses of implementing this regulation, so that we can develop an Economic Impact Assessment which will be required when this regulation is laid in Parliament. We\u2019ll be calling for your feedback at that point \u2013 again it will be highly valued. We\u2019ll also be launching a consultation on the proposal to indefinitely recognise CE marked medical devices \u2013 something I know many of you are keenly interested in.
