Then within Defence, be responsible, as a Project Manager then a Chief Engineer, and latterly Deputy Head for the DE&S Airworthiness Team. When I look at my peer group now, all of whom are successful professionals, my reflection on the training we received as young adults is that it not only taught the basics (the how) but taught us to really understand 'the why'. Of course, all apprenticeships teach you that, but it's not until later in life when you appreciate that trained inquisitiveness becomes your superpower when looking for better outcomes or improvements to products and services.",

Then, I completed six weeks in the Design Office, where I learnt how to use SolidWorks, a Computer Aided Design (CAD) software used for creating solid models, technical drawings and assemblies.
