Unlike other cyberattacks that directly target networks and systems, phishing uses social engineering techniques to expose human error.

Phishing poses a major risk because it targets people rather than technology. Attackers don\u2019t need to hack systems or bypass security tools, they simply manipulate individuals with legitimate access. By doing so, they can obtain money, sensitive data, or other valuable assets without breaking in themselves.",
