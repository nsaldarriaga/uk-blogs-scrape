My family made their way to a new life in India leaving behind all material possessions and our ancestral home, which had changed location overnight from British India to East Pakistan. Independence was expensive: British India was partitioned into three portions; there was carnage and chaos as families desperately traversed borders to reach their destinations. Millions were displaced or dead, so my family were amongst the lucky ones, alive and relatively unscathed. The turbulence continued for decades, particularly in the Eastern part of the country with East Pakistan becoming Bangladesh in 1971. There was limited opportunity or immediate hope for improvement as colonial rule had stripped countries of their assets. Ironically, this led my parents and many others to move to GB as post WWII and the fall of the empire, Britain was welcoming residents from her former colonies to participate in the nation rebuilding process.",

The current arrangements are recognised in Section 87 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 which effectively requires the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and counterpart at the Department for Communities (NI) to consult with each other with a view to securing single systems of social security, child support and pensions for the UK. The commitment to co-ordination (more often referred to as the parity principle) is bolstered by the \u2018Treasury\u2019s Statement of Funding Policy: Funding the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive\u2019. The latest statement from June 2025 outlines that where the: \u2018Northern Ireland Executive\u2019s welfare programmes mirror the equivalent programmes in Great Britain, the UK government will fund the costs. If the Northern Ireland Executive opts to make these programmes more generous then they will need to meet the additional costs\u2019 (para 7.16).In effect, if Northern Ireland wants to do something different it must pay for it including where applicable any workarounds or changes needed to the IT systems which are relied on by the Department for Communities (NI) for delivery of most of its social security provision. This has meant that despite having greater devolved powers than in Scotland, the NI Executive has not moved as far from the principle of parity. Nonetheless, there are significant differences. In 2012 a Welfare Reform Bill equivalent to the Welfare Reform Act in Britain, which introduced significant cuts to social security, did not get through the NI Assembly after being blocked by Sinn Fein and other political parties. The UK government\u2019s response was to work out the savings foregone and to reduce the block grant paid to Northern Ireland by a similar sum. The impasse was finally resolved in the Fresh Start Agreement in 2015 with the Northern Ireland legislation being fast tracked through Westminster Parliament alongside equivalent legislation to the Welfare Reform and Work Act.",

As a result, the \u2018bedroom tax\u2019 and \u2018benefit cap\u2019 while part of the Northern Ireland legislation were mitigated.\u00a0 Moreover, welfare support payments were introduced to provide claimants adversely affected by the move from Disability Living Allowance to Personal Independence Payment (PIP), the curtailment of contributory Employment and \u201cSupport Allowance to 12 months save for those in the support group and other changes all received payments for a defined period to provide a soft landing. In addition, a Discretionary Support scheme was set up to replace the Social Fund providing grants and interest free loans for furniture and household goods and other needs to claimants including those not on means-tested benefits but below an annual income threshold. The scheme also offers a Universal Credit New Claims Grant to tide over claimants struggling to manage the five week wait for a first Universal Credit payment. A second commissioned independent mitigations review published in autumn 2022 recommended a further series of mitigations, however this review did not have an agreed budget in advance and its recommendations have remained largely unrealised.",

At Hinkley Point C, 132 cubic metres of water will need to be sucked up from the estuary every second to cool the turbine condensers. This is the equivalent to drawing 190 Olympic-sized swimming pools full of water from the estuary every hour. EDF estimate that over 7 million fish will be drawn into the intakes annually, and it is expected that around 2.6 million a year are likely to die as a result. As such, putting in place these measures is essential for preventing serious consequences for protected fish populations in our waters and impacts on the fishing industry.",

                "content": "In celebration of National Apprenticeship Week and embracing this year's theme of 'Skills for Life', we look at the positive impact apprenticeships have on individuals, and for the Civil Service by shining a spotlight on one of the GFiE Pathways changing lives: the DWP Social Mobility Apprenticeship (SMA) Pathway.\n\nHere is a look at how this Pathway brings new talent, perspective, and lived experience into the Civil Service.\n\n\u00a0\nWhat the DWP Social Mobility Apprenticeship (SMA) Programme does\nAs part of the wider GFIE approach to inclusive recruitment, the DWP Social Mobility Apprenticeship helps people who might not access jobs through the usual route. It supports registered unemployed people and young people leaving school by offering an 18\u2011month role, with the chance to become permanent colleagues after 12 months.\nSMA gives the opportunity of paid work and gaining a nationally recognised qualification, such as:\n\nCustomer Service level 2 or 3\nBusiness Admin level 3\nCredit Controller and Collector level 2 or\nPublic Sector Compliance Officer level 3.\u00a0\n\nDWP has successfully delivered this programme for over 13 years, offering over\u00a03,000 Social Mobility apprenticeship\u00a0opportunities to\u00a0date, with many progressing into permanent Civil Service roles.\n\nSchool Leavers were added to the programme to help young people who had the prospect of leaving school without employment or training.\n\n29 school leavers have started across Counter Fraud and Debt Management, Disability Services and Retirement Services\u200b\n36 roles are due to start in September 2026\u200b.\n\n\nWho is eligible for SMA?\nCandidates need to be:\n\naged 16 and over and\u00a0\nregistered unemployed, and\nhave limited work experience, low qualifications, or other complex barriers to work that could be removed by furthering their education and experience.\n\nFor School Leaver Apprenticeships candidates must be:\n\n16-19 years old and\nnot going onto further education, employment or training and \nthey must meet at least one of either from a low-income household, expectations of up to 7 qualifications from GCSEs or complex circumstances that create disadvantage. \u200b\n\n\nWhy is SMA important?\nSMA helps DWP to be more representative of the people we serve and\u00a0supports the government skills and youth agenda. It enables us to bring new talent into DWP and helps support and develop the skills of people who would never have considered working in the Civil Service.\u00a0\nDWP is the UK\u2019s largest government department and the nature of the work we do means that we are in a privileged position to drive Social Mobility throughout the UK. This can be through our school advisors engaging with young people to our work coaches spotting potential in their caseload.\u00a0\nWhich roles are offered through SMA?\n\nMost roles are across Operations but could also be in: \n\nCounter Fraud Compliance and Debt (CFCD)\nRetirement Services (RS)\u00a0\nDisability Services (DS)\nPersonal Independence Payment (PIP)\u00a0\nUniversal Credit (UC)\n\nTypical roles offered are: Work Coach, Case Manager, Case Review Agent, Fraud Officer, Debt Management Administrative Officer/Telephony and Software Engineer.\n\nHow do individuals apply?\nDWP Social Mobility Apprenticeships aren\u2019t advertised externally to avoid disadvantaging people facing added barriers. When roles become available, these are shared with Jobcentre work coaches to find and nominate candidates from their caseloads.\u00a0\nSchool Leaver Apprenticeships are not open directly to school leavers. When roles become available, they are advertised in schools and Pupil referral units by the Jobcentre Support for Schools Advisers in England.\nBy championing programmes like SMA as part of the GFIE Network, doors are opened for people who simply need the right opportunity and bring new talent, perspectives and lived experience into Government.\n\n\n",
