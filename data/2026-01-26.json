As part of that review, we identified five proposals to make resolving enforcement cases quicker, easier and more transparent. OFSI sought feedback through a 12-week public consultation, including by running a webinar with 615 participants to share information and seek feedback. I want to thank those who engaged with the consultation. These measures are better and will be more effective as a result of that engagement. We intend to proceed with all proposals from the original consultation, incorporating feedback from responses to the consultation.

The\u00a0Trade Marks\u00a0Registration Act of 1875 limited\u00a0trade marks\u00a0to relating to goods. Over time legislation was expanded so that\u00a0trade marks\u00a0could also be registered in relation to services. A core principle of\u00a0trade mark\u00a0law is that\u00a0trade marks\u00a0are used\u00a0in the course of\u00a0business. Historically this would have related to physical\u00a0commerce\u00a0but the invention of the world wide web enabled the advertising of goods and services online, as well as e-commerce. As a result,\u00a0trade marks\u00a0are being used and interacted with in digital contexts more than ever before and in relation to goods and services someone in 1875 could never had imagined.\u00a0\u00a0",

This graphic representation requirement was later repealed with\u00a0trade mark\u00a0criteria being expanded to signs \u201c\u2026being represented on the register in a manner which enables the competent authorities and the public to determine the clear and precise subject matter of the protection afforded to its proprietor.\u201d (Directive (EU) 2015/2436).

                "content": "Millions of homeowners \u2013 mostly flat owners \u2013 will save significant cash thanks to a new major shake\u2011up of the leasehold system. If you own a flat or are looking to buy one, you probably know about the excessive charges you may have to pay on top of your mortgage and other bills. Ground rents are often inescapable because they have to be paid under the terms of your lease. Some landlords charge a substantial amount for no clear service in return. The Prime Minister has announced huge changes to put this to an end \u2013 a turning point for millions of homeowners whose lives are plagued by these charges. Here is what the government is doing to protect your pockets from unfair charges: 1. Ground rent will be CAPPED \u2013 no more spiralling bills Many flat owners pay ground rent that can shoot up a lot. You may not even realise that it is going to increase until you get the bill. Ground rent is a payment to the owner of the land your flat sits on. That\u2019s being stopped. - If you have a ground rent it will be capped at \u00a3250 a year. - And after 40 years it will be cut to a peppercorn, so nothing is paid. - This will apply to most residential leasehold contracts that were entered into before July 2023, meaning big savings and no nasty financial surprises. 2. New leasehold flats will be banned This is huge. In future, developers will no longer be allowed to sell new flats as leasehold (except in limited cases). Instead, new flats will be built as commonhold \u2013 meaning you own the ground your flat is built on and the overall building with your neighbours. This is a fairer system used widely in other countries, giving flat ownership a whole new meaning (because it\u2019s actually all yours!). The government is consulting on the details, including trickier cases where exemptions might be needed and timing arrangements to ensure the transition to commonhold is smooth. Moving to a commonhold system will mean: - You own your flat outright - You and your neighbours jointly own and run the building, you might hire a managing agent to look after the property, but they will be accountable to you - There\u2019s no landlord above you charging more than needed - You get a proper say over spending, repairs and local rules 3. Existing leaseholders will get the right to switch to commonhold If you already own a leasehold flat, you won\u2019t be left behind. The government will make it much easier for existing leaseholders to convert to commonhold, so they benefit too. 4. You can\u2019t lose your home over tiny debts anymore At the moment, some people can lose their home for owing as little as \u00a3350 in fees. This extreme rule called forfeiture will be scrapped. A new, fairer system will be introduced and replaced with a new court-led process with strict safeguards for more extreme cases. 5. Service charges and building costs will be more transparent These leasehold reforms build on changes already coming that will: - make service charge bills clearer and easier to understand - help people challenge unfair costs - force landlords and their managing agents to be more accountable - and reduce mystery fees or unexplained hikes. 6. More power for freehold homeowners against excessive estate charges \u2013 a big crackdown on \u2018fleecehold\u2019 estates  If you own a freehold house on a privately managed estate (often new builds), you might still be paying extra fees for the upkeep of parks, roads and shared areas, even though you already pay council tax. This is often called \u2018fleecehold\u2019 and nearly two million households are affected. We want to reduce the use of this approach going forwards, putting an end to its unjustified use for the majority of new homes. The government is also consulting on recently announced major reforms, meaning: \u274c The harsh 100\u2011year\u2011old law used to punish homeowners will be banned Right now, missing a payment (even as low as \u00a3100) can mean losing access to your home or even having a lease slapped onto it. This draconian power will be scrapped. \ud83d\udcc4 Standard, clearer bills so you can challenge unfair charges Homeowners will get simple, standardised information about estate charges to help them spot unreasonable fees and challenge them. No more mystery bills or surprise add\u2011ons. \ud83d\udc65 A new \u2018substitute manager\u2019 if the current one fails If a management company isn\u2019t doing its job - for example, leaving roads unmaintained or green spaces neglected - a tribunal will be able to appoint a new manager to take over. This gives residents proper backing when things go wrong. \ud83c\udfd8\ufe0f Government will look at making resident\u2011controlled management the default The government is exploring whether residents should run their estates themselves, instead of being forced to rely on a private management company with no accountability.
