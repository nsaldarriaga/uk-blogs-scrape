This depth is based on ecological factors rather than the previous post-war 40cm definition (used in the 2021 regs) which was based on the exploitation potential of peat. Peat forms wherever waterlogging prevents complete decomposition of dead plant matter. As such, any accumulation of such waterlogged material can be classed as \u2018peat\u2019. A thickness of 30cm or more is also recognised as a useful threshold for blanket bog plant species.\u00a0 We agree that \u2013 by lowering the regulatory threshold to include peat deeper than 30cm \u2013 this will increase the amount of peat and associated habitats protected from burning and enable their hydrological function to be restored. \u00a0Once restored to a healthy functioning state, peatland habitats will make a vital contribution to the Government\u2019s Net Zero and EIP targets \u2013 storing carbon, improving water quality and helping protect communities from flooding.",
