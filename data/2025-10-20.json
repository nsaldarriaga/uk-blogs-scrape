As the electromagnetic spectrum becomes increasingly congested and contested, the search for alternative communication technologies has taken centre stage. One such promising avenue is Optical Wireless Communications (OWC), specifically Free Space Optical Communications (FSOC), which offers a non-radio frequency (RF) alternative for long-range, point-to-point wireless communications. Recently, I had the privilege of working with the Yeoman of Signals (YofS) students on an exciting OWC project sponsored by the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). This project not only explored the potential of FSOC technology but also provided a unique opportunity to engage with the next generation of military communicators.",
