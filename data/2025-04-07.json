She had announced that on 7 April 2025 the Fair Repayment Rate will reduce the maximum deductions that can be taken from a claimant\u2019s Universal Credit (UC) personal allowance from 25 to 15 percent. This would ensure that people on the lowest incomes can keep more of their UC.

However, the particular solution DWP had adopted meant that more households than before would have child deductions made, and some would see substantial increases in total deductions. Whilst this would benefit the households where their children (from a previous relationship) lived, the evidence we saw told us very little about the composition of, or impact on, households whose monthly income would drop as a result, including the impact on any children in their current household. We concluded that this was partly because of the absence of available data, and partly because DWP had not carried out sufficient analysis of potential effects, in particular the various ways the changes might affect disabled people.[2] We were also concerned about potential risks arising from child maintenance discussions displacing other deductions like those for fuel, and we thought that the date the regulations would come into force was not well enough aligned with the Fair Repayment Rate change.",
