The Code is issued by the Prime Minister and, whilst he is always accountable to Parliament, it is his absolute prerogative, to advise The King on who serves as ministers in HM Government. The IA therefore has never had any power beyond the parameters approved by the Prime Minister, but it is significant that those parameters have been materially broadened during the last five years, with greater public awareness of the IA\u2019s status.",

The IA can also require that any resulting advice to the Prime Minister is published. This independence and transparency is very significant but, as Head of the Executive, it is solely the Prime Minister\u2019s decision as to the outcome that follows such advice.

This perception, which is distorted by the actions of a small minority and also the changing nature and polarisation of political discourse, differs markedly from what I believe to be the reality based on my interaction with ministers. Since my appointment in December 2022, I have found that the holders of ministerial office in general understand the privilege of their positions, recognise their responsibilities under the Ministerial Code and are diligent in upholding high standards of behaviour. My job is to advise the Prime Minister and, where appropriate, his ministers to ensure good practice and thereby, with others responsible for upholding standards in public life, to help move the dial of public confidence in a more positive direction.",
