As a regulator, the Commissioner\u2019s role is to provide public assurance that these appointments are made through a fair and open process, based on merit. So when ministers appoint someone to a public body, the post must be openly advertised and they must select from a group of candidates whose experience and skills have been assessed by a panel, which includes an independent member. The independent panel member plays a crucial role in ensuring that the process is fair to all candidates and in line with the Governance Code and Principles of Public Appointments.\u00a0",

Despite the changes recommended in 2016, the latest figures in my annual report show that only 13% of appointments last year met the 3 month aim set out in the Governance Code. Many competitions take far too long, often lasting six months or more. This not only frustrates candidates but can also lead to the loss of strong applicants who choose to take up other opportunities in the meantime. Delays also mean leaving key public bodies without leadership for extended periods, reducing the effectiveness of those bodies and the services they deliver to the taxpayer.

The \u2018IN\u2019 route has been operated from Liverpool to Dublin, running since 1970 and collecting over 4000 samples in that time. Plankton in each sample are then counted and identified as precisely as possible, often down to the species level. The resulting dataset is open access and has been used in a large number of research projects, as well as more applied work within the marine policy realm. Data from the CPR Survey, from both the IN route and surrounding North Sea / north-eastern Atlantic, can be used to put other plankton sampling results into a wider context, adding large spatial and temporal scales to look at changes in the community.",

But all this is dwarfed by their value as a carbon store. The value of reduced carbon emissions from restoring all peatlands in the UK would be between 5 and 10 times the cost of restoration. At a conservative estimate, restoring 55% of peatlands to near-natural condition would have a value of around \u00a350 billion.
