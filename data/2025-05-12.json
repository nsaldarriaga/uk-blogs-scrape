Whilst prevention remains the most effective defence, accidental introductions can still happen. In such cases, early detection and rapid response is crucial for preventing these species from establishing in the environment. This is especially true in our marine environments where, once established, these species are extremely difficult to control and often impossible to eradicate.",

This species is a non-native marine mollusc that could have severe impacts on our native species and economy. The Japanese oyster drill is native to the North Pacific and has established non-native populations in the Netherlands, but had not yet been recorded in the UK. This potential sighting was of concern as this species preys on oysters, scallops, mussels and cockles, by drilling through their shells to eat their flesh. If this species were to establish in UK waters, it could have economic effects on shellfish farms, as well as environmental effects on, for example, oyster reef regeneration projects.",

Experts were consulted to try to confirm the identification, and a survey was organised on the surrounding beaches to look for Japanese oyster drills or their egg-cases. No further evidence of the species was found, and from the original photographs it was decided that the egg-cases may have been from our native oyster drill, as their eggs look very similar. However, an awareness-raising programme was launched to ensure that interested parties in the area knew how to report any further sightings if they occurred.\u00a0 \u00a0",

Sightings in northern Europe have increased in the last few decades, but there had only been five isolated previous sightings in UK waters. It therefore came as a surprise in October when another blue crab was found off the coast at Brighton, this time found by a Cefas fisheries observer on a fishing boat.\u00a0",

This means that only one animal is required to establish a breeding population. An adult can produce up to 270 eggs every 8\u20139 weeks with sexual maturity being reached 25\u201335 weeks after hatching, under optimum conditions.

This poses the risk that they may have a devastating direct impact on native aquatic fauna and flora if released into our waters.\u00a0 Marbled crayfish can survive in temperate waters, so there is a real concern that this alien species will become established in Great Britain if introduced.\u00a0",

Delays also mean leaving key public bodies without leadership for extended periods, reducing the effectiveness of those bodies and the services they deliver to the taxpayer.

The map also shows the locations of many thousands of drainage channels, which are often closely connected to dried-out, deteriorating peatlands. Taken together, the data provides the most detailed understanding of peatland extent and features ever available at an England-wide scale. \u00a0",

New peat only forms at a rate of about 1mm a year, so by far the best way of ensuring that we continue to receive its benefits is by not letting it degrade in the first place and restoring damaged peatlands. Figures from the Office for National Statistics indicate that our peatlands\u2019 value as a source of drinking water is worth many hundreds of millions, while our 180 million hours of recreational visits to them were worth \u00a3274 million. But all this is dwarfed by their value as a carbon store. The value of reduced carbon emissions from restoring all peatlands in the UK would be between 5 and 10 times the cost of restoration. At a conservative estimate, restoring 55% of peatlands to near-natural condition would have a value of around \u00a350 billion. In allowing us to measure how much peat we have in locations across England, and the features of our peatland landscapes, the England Peat Map will give decision makers vital information to help them make the right choices for these irreplaceable national assets.",
