Instead of the standard 6-month treatment, I faced 12 months of gruelling medication.

If you catch flu during pregnancy, it can also cause your baby to be born prematurely or have a low birth weight and, if you get infection near to delivery, you can also pass it to your newborn baby. Babies under 6 months of age have one of the highest hospitalisation rates for flu every season. Vaccinating against flu during your pregnancy means that you will make an immune response (including antibodies) to the vaccine, and these protective antibodies are passed onto your baby through the placenta,\u00a0 helping to protect your baby for the first few months of their life.\u00a0You can have the flu vaccine at any stage of pregnancy, from conception onwards.\u00a0",

With so many species now threatened and regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), ensuring that trade is legal and sustainable is not just an international obligation, but a national priority for conserving marine biodiversity. As a CITES Party, Indonesia must ensure that all trade in listed species is legal, traceable, and sustainable, an increasingly complex task as more sharks and rays are listed on the Appendices of the CITES convention.",

A misidentified specimen can lead to incorrect reporting, undetected illegal trade, or an overlooked opportunity to intervene. Addressing illegal trade requires more than regulations, it demands people are skilled, confident, and equipped to identify species accurately at landing sites, checkpoints, processing facilities, and export hubs. And for Indonesia to meet its ambition to reduce illegal trade through stronger cohesion among authorities, better tools, and improved compliance, one thing is clear: people must have the skills to recognise what they are looking at.",
