For centuries, coastal communities have relied on marine resources for food and livelihoods. Today, Indonesia is also one of the world\u2019s largest producers and exporters of shark and ray products, bringing with it both responsibility and opportunity. With so many species now threatened and regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), ensuring that trade is legal and sustainable is not just an international obligation, but a national priority for conserving marine biodiversity. As a CITES Party, Indonesia must ensure that all trade in listed species is legal, traceable, and sustainable, an increasingly complex task as more sharks and rays are listed on the Appendices of the CITES convention.",

Sharks and rays do not arrive neatly labeled; they come as whole specimens, frozen blocks, fin sets, dried products, and processed meat. Some species look deceptively similar. A misidentified specimen can lead to incorrect reporting, undetected illegal trade, or an overlooked opportunity to intervene. Addressing illegal trade requires more than regulations, it demands people are skilled, confident, and equipped to identify species accurately at landing sites, checkpoints, processing facilities, and export hubs. And for Indonesia to meet its ambition to reduce illegal trade through stronger cohesion among authorities, better tools, and improved compliance, one thing is clear: people must have the skills to recognise what they are looking at.",
