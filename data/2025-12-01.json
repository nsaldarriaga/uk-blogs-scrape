With so many species now threatened and regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), ensuring that trade is legal and sustainable is not just an international obligation, but a national priority for conserving marine biodiversity.

Addressing illegal trade requires more than regulations, it demands people are skilled, confident, and equipped to identify species accurately at landing sites, checkpoints, processing facilities, and export hubs. And for Indonesia to meet its ambition to reduce illegal trade through stronger cohesion among authorities, better tools, and improved compliance, one thing is clear: people must have the skills to recognise what they are looking at.",
