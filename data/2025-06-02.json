Not everyone is aware these roles exist, let alone how important they are. Those that do know about these roles, including in the UK veterinary profession, perceive the role to be unpleasant and unfulfilling. Yet on the continent, VPH roles are held in high regard, with a steady stream of vets wanting to work in this field. This discrepancy has meant that European vets have delivered the vital role of an abattoir OV in the UK and when we experienced the double challenges of COVID and Brexit, we realised how fragile this recruitment pipeline really is.",

Where we have seen most success is with increased recognition and interest in VPH roles by the wider profession. A notable example of this is our invite to host a table at the Society of Practicing Veterinary Surgeons annual conference in January 2025 and talk about leadership in the profession, something that would never have happened previously. Historically the domain of clinical veterinary leaders, our invite signals a huge shift. Maximising the opportunity, we further built on our visibility, highlighting to delegates the skills and benefits working in civil service roles can bring to individual careers and the wider profession. Over fifty delegates and veterinary leaders joined our table, including the BVA president and RCVS Director for Advancement of the Profession, with discussions covering flexible working, leaderships styles, career progression and much more.Raising the profile of the FSA and all its veterinary roles, including the role of an OV, is not over but with the help of many people across the FSA we are far along the path of creating cultural change\u2026 who said changing the perception of a population was impossible?",
