The Human Medicines Regulations 2012 however offers clear information for a company to qualify their customer. Schedule 17, (The Human Medicines Regulations 2012) documents the exemptions from the restrictions on sale and supply of medicinal products. These exemptions are in respect to specific medicines contained within Schedule 17 and does not grant the person exempted free reign of all medicines unless explicitly stated. Whilst using Schedule 17 to qualify a customer it is expected that this is fully documented and described within the Quality Management System. It is expected that an order can be fully traced back to the person placing an order, and it is critical to ensure the person doing so is legitimate and has authority. An example may be the commander of a plane or the master vessel is allowed to purchase medicines, the MHRA Inspectors would require companies to demonstrate that the individual and plane or vessel are validated prior to supply. For ease the company that owns the vessel can place the order of their behalf, however the order placed must be identical to that placed by the commander.",

Medicinal products should not be left on alternative premises\u201d.\u00a0 Achieving this can be challenging in both aviation and marine scenarios due to restricted access to docks and airports, and the lack of direct access to airside or offshore locations. The MHRA takes a pragmatic approach allowing companies to deliver orders to the goods inwards facility at ports or airports, but companies must ensure that there is clear documentation evidencing that the order has made it to the destination in time. There should also be a \u201cjust in time\u201d mentality. Orders should not be stored for long periods of time in port or airport facilities before being loaded onto the ship or aircraft, as this would require those facilities to be licenced. Organisations undertaking such activity should take reasonable steps to ensure that supplies are compliant with GDP guidance, and consider undertaking, and regularly reviewing, a risk assessment to identify areas of concern prior to supply.",

Not everyone is aware these roles exist, let alone how important they are. Those that do know about these roles, including in the UK veterinary profession, perceive the role to be unpleasant and unfulfilling. Yet on the continent, VPH roles are held in high regard, with a steady stream of vets wanting to work in this field. This discrepancy has meant that European vets have delivered the vital role of an abattoir OV in the UK and when we experienced the double challenges of COVID and Brexit, we realised how fragile this recruitment pipeline really is.",

Where we have seen most success is with increased recognition and interest in VPH roles by the wider profession. A notable example of this is our invite to host a table at the Society of Practicing Veterinary Surgeons annual conference in January 2025 and talk about leadership in the profession, something that would never have happened previously. Historically the domain of clinical veterinary leaders, our invite signals a huge shift. Maximising the opportunity, we further built on our visibility, highlighting to delegates the skills and benefits working in civil service roles can bring to individual careers and the wider profession. Over fifty delegates and veterinary leaders joined our table, including the BVA president and RCVS Director for Advancement of the Profession, with discussions covering flexible working, leaderships styles, career progression and much more.Raising the profile of the FSA and all its veterinary roles, including the role of an OV, is not over but with the help of many people across the FSA we are far along the path of creating cultural change\u2026 who said changing the perception of a population was impossible?",
