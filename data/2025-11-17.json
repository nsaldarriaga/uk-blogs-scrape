Funded by the UK Department of Health and Social Care, AMROH supports Fleming Fund Country Grants by strengthening AMR surveillance across animal health including aquaculture and environment sectors. There are several AMROH grants targeted at Lower- and middle-Income Countries (LMICs) regions e.g. West Africa, East Africa, South and South East Asia. The grant the Reference Centre leads targets four West African countries\u2014Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. Recent milestones include workshops on antimicrobial residues in Ghana, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) training in Ghana, Sierra Leone and Senegal, and the feedback on the surveillance strategies in all four recipient countries.
