Having the plan is great but you must stick to it to ensure the service is meeting user needs and to support team success at beta assessment\u00a0\nstrive to include individuals with accessibility needs, ESL and low digital literacy in every round of user research where possible. Your proposed plan appears to give a relatively short period of time to focusing on these individuals, they should feature throughout all your research and be a constant consideration in recruitment\u00a0\namend your research plan considering pre-election period\u00a0\ninform the DHSC digital assurance team to help with designing a more realistic plan if you feel that you cannot deliver against your user research plan in the timeframe stated\u00a0\u00a0\nensure that you are aware of, and working to confirm or disprove, your riskiest assumptions about your user group and the service you are creating\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nensure that the service you are creating caters to the needs of a broad range of users. It may appear that the user group is highly digitally literate at present, but this is not a certainty, nor will it necessarily be the case for all future users. The service should be designed for those with the most complex needs with regards to literacy, ESL, accessibility. If the service meets the needs of these users, it will meet the needs of the average user\u00a0\nkeep in mind that an individual's self-assessment of their digital literacy is not an accurate measure of their actual ability\nmake use of recruitment approaches beyond agencies, particularly if this route is delaying your research. There was a mention of using charities to recruit individuals with accessibility needs, this can often be a very fruitful approach and would be worth exploring. Ensure that you can show the panel at the beta assessment that you are doing all you can to recruit appropriate participants\n\n",

Digital transformation is the process of changing an organisation to have digital services at its core. This isn't just a change which impacts people working in IT, but one that affects the whole organisation and the way people work. The change to working in delivery groups and the new governance model are a small part of a much larger transformation taking part across Defra.",
