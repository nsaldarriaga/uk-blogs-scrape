The grey squirrel-specific feeders will be deployed and monitored using cameras to confirm that only grey squirrels are accessing the bait. These feeders use a clever weight threshold mechanism: the door to the bait only opens for animals weighing over 450 grams. Since grey squirrels are nearly twice the weight of reds, this threshold allows over 90% of adult greys access while excluding all red squirrels, something our research has so far demonstrated, but that needs to be fully tested on a larger scale.",
