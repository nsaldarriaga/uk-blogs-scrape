By way of a response to some of these issues, DWP has just appointed a Director for Youth and NEET, Alex Fitzpatrick. We look forward to working with Alex and her colleagues as our research proceeds through the summer and autumn, with a plan to send our findings \u2013 on what is working well and any weaknesses that we uncover \u2013 and recommendations for any reforms needed to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions by the end of the year.",
