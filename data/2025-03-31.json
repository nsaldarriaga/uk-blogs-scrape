Britain and Ireland are home to about 13% of the global blanket bog resource (see UK Peatland Strategy 2018-2040). Like other peatlands, blanket bogs form when sphagnum mosses and other plant material dies and accumulates in waterlogged conditions. In good condition, blanket bogs continue to accumulate carbon indefinitely and they retain large volumes of water (providing natural flood prevention). Their wet state also makes them more resilient to wildfires.\u00a0\u00a0",
