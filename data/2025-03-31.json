My own career has been spent approximately 1/3 in children\u2019s social work, 1/3 in adult social work and 1/3 in the NHS, so have been keen to reflect on this question. Social work training and practice focus on the importance of working in a person-centred, relational, participatory, strengths-based way that is strongly influenced by principles of social justice. When I first worked in the NHS, these were not phrases I generally heard my clinical colleagues using, but now they have much greater currency in the organisation and I think mean that social workers can bring a valuable diversity of thought, experience, skills and ideas to our besieged, but much loved, healthcare system. In my first social work placement in a hospital team, we were working in the NHS, but seconded from the local authority, which meant we were not considered a core profession in the NHS. ",
