Currently, there is no formal recognition of baby losses prior to 24 weeks gestation, leaving some bereaved parents struggling to find closure. DHSC commissioned NHSBSA to create the service to fill this gap. It is an online application form which, upon successful completion, results in a physical certificate of loss. The aim is to provide recognition of a life lost and to provide comfort to bereaved parents. It is an optional service, and it is not a legal document.\u00a0",
