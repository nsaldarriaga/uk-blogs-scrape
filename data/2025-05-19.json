But this approach has come at a steep environmental cost, and continuing down this path puts the future of farming at risk.

Some delivery mechanisms report every financial year rather than calendar year, so for these delivery mechanisms we only have one full year\u2019s data since the target began.

Whilst we do not currently have sufficient data to show this level of action, we can see that a significant amount of this has been delivered and reported, and we are confident this number will increase as further data become available. Delivery of the target is also unlikely to be completely linear, as large-scale projects like those in the Landscape Recovery scheme have not yet started to deliver.

Aquatic habitats are particularly difficult to report on as they are often impacted by multiple pressures, meaning that a single action is rarely sufficient to restore them. Consequently, no actions for aquatic habitats have been included in this year\u2019s report, as we did not have the evidence to be confident that sufficient action was underway to completely restore a water body.
