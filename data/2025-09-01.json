This challenge is not an insignificant one, given the pace at which science continues to advance and new technologies emerge.In the Government Office for Science\u2019s Emerging Technology team, one of our aims is to strengthen cross-government collaboration on emerging technology. A problem that we identified was that people using different terms for identical, or overlapping, technologies was holding back collaboration. For example, which are the most important technologies out of AI, neural networks or machine learning? This isn\u2019t a question likely to lead to useful insight.",

New technologies don\u2019t neatly evolve from an ancestor. Often, a new technology will be the combination of several innovations. The taxonomy structure is always going to be a judgement we could revisit. For example, does quantum computing sit in quantum technology or future computing? Of course, it\u2019s both.

This can bring challenging domestic and international policy issues, lead to substantial socioeconomic impacts, and present wholly new opportunities or risks for government.
