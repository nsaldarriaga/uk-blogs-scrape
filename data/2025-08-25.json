This means that leaseholders are protected from having to pay to fix safety issues in their building, even if the costs were incurred before the law came into force. \u00a0\u00a0In the first case, Adriatic Land 5 Ltd v Long Leaseholders at Hippersley Point, the Court confirmed that Schedule 8 to the Act, which prevents landlords from passing on historical building safety costs to leaseholders, covers costs incurred before the legislation was introduced. The Court also ruled that these protections are compatible with human rights law, striking a fair balance between landlord\u2019s interests and the wider public interest in making homes safe.",

RCOs are a legal remedy introduced by the Act which can be used to secure funds towards essential remediation work. These powers allow leaseholders and others to ask the Tribunal to order developers, landlords or associated companies to contribute towards the costs of fixing historical building safety issues. The judgment confirms that public funds should only be used as a last resort.\u00a0\u00a0While further appeals to the Supreme Court are possible, the Court of Appeal\u2019s decisions provide important legal clarity on the scope and application of the Building Safety Act 2022.\u00a0",
