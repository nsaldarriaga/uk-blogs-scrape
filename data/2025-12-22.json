Marking an important step in UK regulatory reform programme, these new rules came into force in June and has led to increased reporting by manufacturers. While more reports of incidents might seem worrying, it\u2019s actually a sign that the regulations are working and issues can now be found and resolved faster, for the benefit of patients. These changes have laid a strong foundation for future reforms in medical technology regulation.",

Having confirmed our approach to the first of these aims in the consultation response, at the very end of July we published a statement of policy intent setting out a key element of our proposed approach to the second: an early access service for innovative devices. The statement set out at a high level our policy intent for early access and the team has since been working hard to develop and flesh out this policy approach and will be reaching out to key stakeholders to develop it further in the new year.",

The feedback we have received has informed updates to existing guidance on the exemption published this month and will support further policy developments next year. The second asked for stakeholder views on priority designated standards.
