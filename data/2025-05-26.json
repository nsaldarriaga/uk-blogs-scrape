The digital mammography screening test takes pictures of each breast from 2 angles. Screening helps catch breast cancer, reducing the chance of death from the condition by 20%. However, screening can miss some cancers, particularly in women who have dense breast tissue. About 10% of women have very dense breasts and up to 50% have some mixed dense and fatty tissue. Very dense breast tissue shows up on mammograms as white or opaque, making tumours harder to detect.",
