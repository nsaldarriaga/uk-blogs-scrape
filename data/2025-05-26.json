However, screening can miss some cancers, particularly in women who have dense breast tissue. About 10% of women have very dense breasts and up to 50% have some mixed dense and fatty tissue.

In the rush to create our teams for the then Department for International Trade (DIT), team structures grew organically at pace. Under pressure to deliver new systems, reporting lines had a rag-tag mix of professions, roles and services. Unfortunately, this led to pools of inconsistent practice and technology. This made quality control and cyber monitoring difficult, but it also meant it was hard to move people across priorities. We felt this impacted people\u2019s professional development and career opportunities, and our function felt too siloed from the rest of the department.",
