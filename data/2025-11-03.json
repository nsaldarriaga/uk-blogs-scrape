The actions of this group are vitally important to ensure livestock, wildlife and pets\u00a0are protected from any escalating disease situations. Their swift and coordinated actions are crucial to protecting livestock, wildlife, and pets from escalating threats.

Early identification of outbreaks and effective control reduce animal loss and financial losses to the farmer. They also protect the consumer from high food prices and zoonotic disease. During this visit the NEEG team shared their expert knowledge in disease control with the Ghanaian delegation. This included an emphasis on High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) in particular, as mitigating the risks from this will support the high-profile national policy to increase poultry production and reduce reliance on food imports. \u00a0",
