The platform is scalable and adaptable to accommodate new data types as needs evolve.Now the data has been ingested, it needs to be stored.

For example, the River Severn catchment received only two-thirds of the rainfall it normally does in June, while the Trent catchment fared worse, with only 37% of its long-term average for June. Lack of rain combined with warm temperatures lead to low water levels and less oxygen in rivers and streams \u2013 a stressful situation for the wildlife that depend on them. ",
