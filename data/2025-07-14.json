AI has become increasingly sophisticated, and more and more products are marketed as having AI functionality. To capture the rapidly evolving trends in AI and to monitor the benefits and risks of the role of AI in product safety, OPSS recently delivered an update to its 2021 report on AI in consumer products.\u00a0\u00a0",

Notably, the use of Generative AI to produce content including images, videos and audio has become commonplace. Regarding consumer trends, smart connected home devices, often featuring AI, have grown by a third since 2017-2018. The research also notes the rising use of smart wearables with integrated generative AI. For example, smart glasses\u2019 innovative functions include image recognition with real time descriptions, translation of foreign languages and use by drivers to monitor fatigue and provide hazard alerts. Robotics have evolved to include AI-driven assistance with domestic chores, allowing user interaction, as well as their development for use in industrial settings, such as to guard and patrol warehouses.\u00a0",
