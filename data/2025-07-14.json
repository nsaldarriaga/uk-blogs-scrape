It provides a centralised, secure, and scalable environment thatautomatically ingests, processes, and stores data across theorganisation - eliminating repetitive manual tasks and enabling faster, more reliable access to trusted data.The platform currently supports the ingestion of data from a wide rangeof sources, including databases such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL andOracle. In addition to databases, it can also pull data from: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Microsoft Dataverse, Microsoft SharePoint sites and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). The platform is scalable and adaptable to accommodate new data types as needs evolve.Now the data has been ingested, it needs to be stored. Homes Englanduses a cloud based storage solution, which ensures the platformremains scalable as data volumes increase. The data is stored in Deltaformat, a powerful structure that offers several advantages: it supportsefficient querying, simplifies version control through built in delta historytracking, and integrates seamlessly with analytics tools.

For example, the River Severn catchment received only two-thirds of the rainfall it normally does in June, while the Trent catchment fared worse, with only 37% of its long-term average for June. Lack of rain combined with warm temperatures lead to low water levels and less oxygen in rivers and streams \u2013 a stressful situation for the wildlife that depend on them. ",
