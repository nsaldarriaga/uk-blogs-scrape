I am relatively new to the Civil Service and wasn\u2019t exactly sure what a working group should look like outside of academia. Imposter syndrome was of course rife and the purpose of the group, to get more women into technical engineering roles, is not an insignificant task. We settled on what might seem like a simple goal: increase the number of women and non-binary people in technical roles. We deliberately chose to measure this in actual numbers rather than percentages, because percentages can be misleading when teams are growing and changing. It's easier to track progress when you're saying \"we had 20, now we have 40\" rather than getting tangled up in shifting denominators.\u00a0",

When you're talking about diversity issues, you're inevitably going to touch on some painful experiences.

You can't create that environment overnight, especially when many of us had never worked together before. So, we kept the group small and for the moment don't admit new members - adding people would have altered that foundation of trust, and too many voices, introductions and recaps of ground rules could have meant less action in the short timeframes we have.\u00a0",
