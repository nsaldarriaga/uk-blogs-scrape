Developing legislation rapidly in the face of humanitarian crises inevitably raises the risk of error and/or oversight. Therefore the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC), during its statutory scrutiny of such regulations, has since 2021 consistently recommended to successive ministers that they introduce a standard legislative framework that would cover future similar humanitarian situations without the requirement to bring forward new regulations.\u00a0This would ensure that people in similar circumstances would be treated consistently and enable DWP to respond faster to emergencies. Bringing forward a legislative framework of this nature is not without complexity and requires significant negotiation to secure cross-government agreement.
