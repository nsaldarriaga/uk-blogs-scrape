We disposed (dealt with and closed) approximately the same number of cases during this time. These disposals are huge numbers and testament to the monumental role of frontline court staff, judges, advocates, solicitors and all of those who work in the criminal justice system. However, despite these efforts, caseloads in both the magistrates\u2019 and Crown Court continue to grow.\u00a0\u00a0",

There are several reasons for this, but the end result is that despite the efforts of everyone working in the criminal courts, the Crown Court outstanding caseload (sometimes known as \"the backlog\") currently stands at over 73,000 cases. In the magistrates courts it is over 330,00 cases. While there will always be a significant number of cases awaiting trial or hearing, this number is far higher than any of us would want it to be. We know that the delays this causes are not acceptable and each case affects people, whether they're victims, witnesses, defendants or communities.\u00a0",

Equally, we're also seeing a greater level of interest outside of Defence, particularly in business wargaming.\u00a0I think the expansion beyond the Defence field is probably one of the biggest trends I've seen in the last few years.",

The first is\u00a0Operation Overlord Normandy\u00a0because I\u2019ve spent hours playing it with friends. I find it really interesting the impact a single change could have had on the outcome of the operation, for example, the weather. For instance, if it was poor weather meaning no allied air support, then the Germans could have completely stopped the Canadian and British armies. The other game is the\u00a0Counterinsurgency series on Cyprus. For a similar reason, it's a point of history I don't know as much about but being able to identify some of those core principles of counterinsurgency and how you can enact them, in a hobby environment, is really fascinating. It adds an extra level of enjoyment to be able to go \u2018oh, OK, this is why this stuff happens\u2019.\u00a0",
