Having studied Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Further Maths at A Levels, I was used to being in a minority, but this was a new level. I was just one of three women in groups of 30 civilian student engineers and in the whole college there were about 15 women out of 400 Royal Navy trainee engineers. It made being a minority even more extreme, everything you did stood out and was noticed, for good or for bad. For me this was a motivator, it made me push forward to do my best, to build networks and to ensure that I stood out for good reasons.\u00a0",
