It\u2019s these direct conversations that bring the challenges, and opportunities, into sharp focus, and can be fuel for our collective ambition to build a digital government that truly serves the public.",

This included a year at Manadon to learn about the Royal Navy, before going to university to study Naval Architecture. Having studied Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Further Maths at A Levels, I was used to being in a minority, but this was a new level. I was just one of three women in groups of 30 civilian student engineers and in the whole college there were about 15 women out of 400 Royal Navy trainee engineers. It made being a minority even more extreme, everything you did stood out and was noticed, for good or for bad. For me this was a motivator, it made me push forward to do my best, to build networks and to ensure that I stood out for good reasons.\u00a0",
