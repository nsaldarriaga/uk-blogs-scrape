They identified many drivers of change for the future, from AI to changes in education and relationships, to inequalities and social media. In the December session, we explored how these drivers might impact childhood in the future, focusing on areas of uncertainty. For example, for AI they imagine potential positive impacts (e.g. for learning), but also negative ones, worrying about its impact on jobs, skills, creativity and social connection.
