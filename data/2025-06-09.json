We also reduced tedious processes, enabling users to focus on higher-value work. All of this would not have been possible either, without plenty of feedback from users. By engaging with them throughout the process, we were able to see how different users were interacting with the tool. This significantly helped us to understand what features and functionality were useful or not. However, this was just an MVP. The Financial Forecasting Tool will continue to evolve, with collaboration at its foundation, so watch this space.",
